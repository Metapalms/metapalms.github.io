            <p>We here at Rock Valley College want to make sure that each and every one of our students have the resources that they need in order to succeed in all of there classes. Once you become a member of the Rock Valley College family you also gain access to the numerous resources we offer, most of which are free.<br>
            The world is changing, technology is used more today than ever before. In order to adapt, many of our classes have online components to them, that help build our student's technology skills. However, we know that not everyone has a way to reach the internet from home. For that reason, we have multiple locations, right here on campus, where you can use a computer and access the net.<br>
            Another incredible service we offer here at Rock Valley College is multiple different ways of getting help on your schoolwork. Let’s be honest, math can get rather complex from time to time. Any math question you have can be answered at the MathLab, located in the basement of the JCSM. If you are having trouble on an essay, just pay a visit to the Writing Center, located in the Student Center. At the Writing Center, you can have English Professors give you advice and pointers on how to better your writing. This is just a small portion of the resources you gain access to when you join the Rock Valley family.

            <div id="megs2"></div>
            <p>Here at Rock Valley College, you have multiple choices of on campus and off campus dining. As pictured above, we have a Meg's Daily Grind right on campus. Meg’s Daily Grind is located in the ERC, a very easy to reach location. We also have both a Papa Johns and Subway located on campus. Both of these places are great choices for a quick and cheap bite to eat. If you’re ever very hungry, and you only have a small break between two classes, Subway and Papa Johns are great places for quick food that will get you back to class on time.<br>
            The great thing about Rock Valley is that you’re not limited to the dining options here on campus. Rock Valley is located at a terrific spot, where some of Rockford’s and Loves Park’s greatest dining options are only minutes away. Restaurants like Beef-a-Roo, House of India, and Buddies Burgers are only minutes away.<br>
            I remember not too long ago, I skipped breakfast before my nine-o’clock class and did not have a break until around three in the afternoon. By the time three rolled by I was starving, and I knew just the place that could fulfill my appetite. I decided to go to “Golden Chopsticks”, one of my favorite restaurants, a trip that is usually around 40 minutes from my house, took only a surprising 10 minutes to reach from Rock Valley.
